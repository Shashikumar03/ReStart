.grep -o -i Harry  Harry\ Potter\ and\ the\ Goblet\ of\ Fire.txt | wc -l

explanation :
            
The command grep -o -i 'Harry' "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.txt" | wc -l is used to count the number of occurrences of the word "Harry" in a case-insensitive manner in the file "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.txt". Let's break down the components of this command:

grep -o -i 'Harry' "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.txt": This command searches for the word "Harry" in the specified file. The options -o tell grep to output only the matched parts of the lines (in this case, the word "Harry"), and -i makes the search case-insensitive.

|: This is the pipe operator, which is used to send the output of one command as input to another command.

wc -l: This command counts the number of lines in the output. Since we're using -o with grep to output only the matched words, each line in the output corresponds to an occurrence of the word "Harry."

5. Print lines from 100 through 200 in the book
sed -n '100,200p' "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.txt"

6. How many unique words are present in the book?
tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '\n' < "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.txt" | sort -u | wc -l
 explanations
 tr -cs '[:alnum:]' '\n': Replaces non-alphanumeric characters with newlines, breaking the text into words.
sort -u: Sorts the words alphabetically and removes duplicates.
wc -l: Counts the number of lines in the output, which corresponds to the number of unique words.
This command will output the count of unique words in the "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.txt" file.
